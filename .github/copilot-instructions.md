# Copilot Instructions for Smart Home State

## Project Overview

- This project manages the state of a smart home system as a single, consistent state.
- It aggregates multiple event sources and updates OpenHAB items via the REST API (OpenHAB is used as a frontend, not as the main state holder).
- The goal is to reduce complexity and inconsistency from managing many OpenHAB items individually.

## Architecture & Key Components

- **src/main/scala/calespiga/**: Main Scala source code.
  - `processor/`: Contains processors for handling and transforming events.
  - `mqtt/`: Handles MQTT communication for event input/output.
  - `model/`: Defines core data models and state representations.
  - `openhab/`: Integrates with the OpenHAB REST API.
  - `persistence/`: State persistence logic.
- **data/**: Contains configuration and state data (e.g., `state.json`).
- **logs/**: Application logs for debugging and monitoring.
- **test-reports/**: XML test reports for CI or local test runs.

## Developer Workflows

- **Build**: Use `sbt compile` to build the project.
- **Test**: Run `sbt test` for all tests. Test reports are output to `test-reports/`.
- **Run**: Use `sbt run` to start the application.
- **Docker**: Use `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile` for containerized deployment.

## Project-Specific Patterns & Conventions

- **Single State Principle**: All device/item states are managed in a single state object, not scattered across multiple OpenHAB items.
- **Event-Driven Processing**: Processors in `processor/` react to events from MQTT, user input, or other sources, and update the state accordingly.
- **Integration Boundaries**: Communication with OpenHAB is isolated in the `openhab/` package. MQTT logic is isolated in `mqtt/`.
- **Testing**: Unit tests are in `src/test/scala/`. Test classes are named `*Suite.scala`.
- **Logging**: Logs are written to `logs/application.log`.

## External Integrations

- **OpenHAB REST API**: Used for reading/writing item states.
- **MQTT**: Used for event input and output.

## Examples

- To add a new event processor, create a class in `processor/` and register it in the main processing pipeline.
- To persist new state fields, update the model in `model/` and the persistence logic in `persistence/`.
